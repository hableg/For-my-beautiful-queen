            <h1>My Dearest yene እማቲ... ❤️</h1>
            <div class="essay-content">
                I’ve been trying to find a way to tell you everything that’s been in my heart for these past 6 months, but a simple text or a phone call just didn't feel like enough. I needed to build something that could actually hold the weight of how much I love you. 

                <span class="highlight">I thank God everyday because of you.</span> I’m not just saying that I mean it from the bottom of my soul. I truly believe that He looked down and saw I needed a light in my life, and He gave me you. You are a God-fearing woman, and your faith is the most beautiful thing about you (well, besides that forehead!). Seeing how you love God makes me want to be a better man every single day. 

                You are the best thing that happened to me this year. Actually, scratch that you’re the best thing that’s happened to me in my entire life. I love your weirdness, your random energy, and your absolute craziness. You’re the only person who can match my vibe and still keep me grounded. You are everything I prayed for in a girl and so much more that I didn't even know I needed.

                Let’s talk about your beauty for a second. You are beautiful in ways that I honestly can't express with words. I look at those <span class="highlight">big, stunning eyes</span> of yours and I’m just gone. Every time you give me that <span class="highlight">gorgeous smile</span>, my heart literally skips a beat. But since we’re being honest... I also love that <span class="highlight">big ass nose</span> of yours and that <span class="highlight">massive legendary forehead</span>! 😂 I honestly think our kids are going to need extra large hats, but it’s okay because they’ll have your beautiful heart (and hopefully my "other" features). 

                You have made me feel loved in a way that is so pure and so deep. I will forever cherish the memories we’ve made in just half a year. But 6 months isn't enough. I want the next 60 years. I want to wake up every morning to that smile, even when you're grumpy and your forehead is taking up half the room. I want to build a life with you, grow old with you, and thank God for you every single day until my last breath.

                I know you probably had to use a dictionary for half of this because the English is a little hard for you, <span class="highlight">የኔ social dumbass</span>! But don't worry about the words just feel the love behind them. You are my world, my answered prayer, and my future. 

                Please don't ever leave me. I don’t even want to imagine a world where you aren't by my side. I love you more than life itself.

                I know I'm not a computer genius or a pro coder, but I wanted to do something that showed you I’m willing to put in the work for you. I spent hours sitting at this screen, writing this code, and making sure every heart and every word was perfect.

                It’s not just a website. It’s a promise that I will always go the extra mile to make you smile. I know it’s "nothing" compared to what you deserve, but I worked hard on this for my queen.
